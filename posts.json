  { "date": "The corruption in Bulgaria is a TOTAL DISASTER. Everybody knows it. Delyan Peevski and his so-called “party” have been stealing from the people for YEARS — unbelievable! And Borisov, what a joke. Always pretending to be the hero while his friends get richer and the people get poorer. They’ve turned Bulgaria into their personal playground, and the media? Totally controlled. Everyone’s afraid to tell the truth! But the people SEE what’s happening. The Bulgarian nation deserves HONEST leadership — not corrupt oligarchs, not fake patriots. The time for change is NOW. We need strength, we need justice, and we need to take our country BACK! HNT" },
